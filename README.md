Description
## Graph.cpp
This class represents a graph.

 This class represents a graph class with a variety of functionalities to create, manipulate, and perform operations on graphs. The class supports both directed and undirected graphs, as well as weighted and unweighted graphs. The library includes overloaded operators for graph addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, and scalar operations.
Features:
    Graph Creation: Initialize graphs with specified vertices and edges.
    Graph Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of graphs.
    Scalar Operations: Increment, decrement, and multiply graph weights by scalars.
    Comparison Operations: Compare graphs for equality, inequality, and subgraph relationships.
    Utility Functions: Print graphs and retrieve graph properties such as the number of vertices, edges, and whether the graph is directed or weighted.
